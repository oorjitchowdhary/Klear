# Klear.

## A Mobile App for Waste Management

### Concept
Klear is an intuitive solution to the careless disposal of waste. We classify trash using Machine Learning into different types - rubber, glass, paper, cardboard, trash and metal and then help in scheduling a pickup of the products specified.

We also suggest DIYs (Do It Yourself) activities to unleash people's creativity.

We act as a middle-man service to earn profits while saving the environment.

### Usage
