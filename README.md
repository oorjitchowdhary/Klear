# Klear.

### A Mobile App for Waste Management

### Concept
Klear is an intuitive solution to the careless disposal of waste. 

We classify trash using our Tensorflow model in Convolutional Neural Network of Machine Learning into **6 main types - rubber, glass, paper, cardboard, trash and metal** 

Now that you know the type of waste product you can schedule a pickup of the products specified in exchange of Klear credits (which can be used in third party services like PayTm, PayPal, Google Tez etc.)

We also give you the chance to donate the Klear credits to charity by clicking a simple button.

We also suggest DIYs (Do It Yourself) & Best Out Of Waste Products using your "waste" material.

Basically, we act as a middle man service to earn profits while saving the environment.
